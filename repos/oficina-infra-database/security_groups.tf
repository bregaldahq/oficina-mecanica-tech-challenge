# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The "badge" pattern.
#
# `db-client` is an EMPTY security group. It grants nothing by itself. Whoever
# attaches it (EKS nodes, Lambda ENIs) is allowed into the RDS instance on 3306,
# because the `db` security group references it as an ingress source.
#
# Why not just reference the EKS node SG directly? Because the node SG is owned
# by `oficina-infra-k8s`, which in turn reads the VPC from this stack. Pointing
# at each other would create a circular dependency between two repositories.
# The badge SG is created here, published to SSM, and merely *consumed*
# downstream -- the dependency stays one-way: database -> k8s -> lambda -> app.
